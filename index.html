    <h1>HELLO</h1> 
      <p>GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline</p>
      <p>You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production</p>
      <span>A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in to your repository and will run when triggered by an event in your repository, or they can be triggered manually, or at a defined schedule.</span>
      <span>An event is a specific activity in a repository that triggers a workflow ru</span>
      <span>A job is a set of steps in a workflow that execute on the same runner.</span>
      <span>A runner is a server that runs your workflows when they're triggered. Each runner can run a single job at a time</span>
